        Hi there, welcome to my playground. When i see some cool animations on the internet i try and make them, in html
        and a basic setup using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">fontawesome</a>
        and <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash</a>. Then i try and recreate the page. This is just a playground
        and you can check everything. If i donnt forget i will also add the <a href="https://codepen.io/">codepen</a>
        example. I do try and think about the responsiveness of the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enjoy!
